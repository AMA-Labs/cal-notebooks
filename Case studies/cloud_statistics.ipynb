    "This notebook explores a Landsat 8 dataset around the city of Hobart in Tasmania, Australia, and generates various statistics related to the percentage of valid and/or cloud-free pixels over the selected time window. This represents potential information of interest to inform subsequent analyses applied the dataset. For example, if there are extensive clouds for a given season, it may significantly impact a resulting mosaic product or a derived dataset of index values. Another example is that a user may want to find a single date when there are few clouds to assess land features.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook considers two types of \"valid pixel\" statistics. On one hand, we define _valid pixels_ as those pixels that have valid data associated with them &ndash; these valid observations might include clear land and/or water, as well as clouds, cloud shadows, saturated pixels, etc. It may be that part of an image in a time slice over a given region of interest has not been imaged by the sensor, in which case the corresponding pixels are _not_ included in the set of _valid pixels_.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, of those pixels providing valid observations, some may be affected by acquisition quality issues such as clouds, saturation, etc. and thus do not provide clear observations of the land and/or water over the region of interest. The pixels _not_ affected by these types of quality issues are here labelled as _clear pixels_.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is adapted from a [CEOS Open Data Cube Notebook](https://github.com/ceos-seo/data_cube_notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/DCAL/DCAL_Cloud_Statistics.ipynb) example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A note regarding compatibility**\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated above, this notebook makes use of a specific dataset of remote sensing data, and is applied over a given region of interest. The code below will thus not run properly if the EASI deployment used to run this notebook does not also contain a similar dataset. Users can nonetheless investigate the outputs provided in this demonstration notebook, and also modify certain variables in the code below to allow the notebook to run with a different EASI deployment (e.g. different remote sensing data, region of interest, etc.)"
